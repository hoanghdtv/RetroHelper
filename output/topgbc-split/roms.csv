Shigeki, the protagonist, a T-Fanger. When arriving to the Denjuu World, Shigeki is determined to befriend Denjuu to solve the various problems in the Denjuu World that crop up from time to time. Shigeki starts with the Denjuu Crypto, and from there, befriends and battles other Denjuu. In a battle, a T-Fanger can have from one to three Denjuu to battle. They bring Denjuu by calling them. A T-Fanger will always have one Denjuu with them, but the other two have to be called in order to have them battle. The better the coverage on the T-Fanger’s D-Shot, the more Denjuu they can use in battle.

This can serve an important role in deciding which Denjuu to pick, and can be a tough decision to make when stronger Denjuu live farther away than weaker Denjuu. Also, Shigeki can see the opponent’s Denjuu ahead of time, which can affect his decision on which Denjuu to use. Each Denjuu has a certain habitat type (out of 6), which affects the damage done to other Denjuu. All of a Denjuu’s moves are the same as their type. Depending on the matchup against another Denjuu, a Denjuu’s attacks can do either greater damage than usual, or less damage than usual. The type matchups are a 6-way rock-paper-scissors chain: Forest Aquatic Desert Grassland Mountain Sky Forest. Due to the nature of 3-on-3 battles, a Denjuu can have a type that covers the weaknesses of a teammate’s Denjuu, making some battles interesting. Each Denjuu has a moveset from 2-4 moves, which expands as the Denjuu levels up. While the moves are fixed, they often change (and typically get more powerful) when they evolve. Each move can do various things, such as deal damage, raise a stat, inflict status conditions, heal, and so on. Also, the fourth move is always a Denma Attack — this is a powerful move, and runs off the attacker’s Denma Attack stat and the opponent’s Denma Defense stat. However, the tradeoff is that takes many turns to charge up, which can mean that the Denjuu may be defeated before it gets fully charged. Also, it can miss, so when it does, there are many turns wasted. Finally, there are moves that some Denjuu have that evade attacks, including Denma Attacks, which can also mean many turns wasted. This adds strategy in whether Denma Attacks are good to use or not. Each Denjuu can evolve in different ways, with complex evolution chains. The most common method is natural evolution, which takes place when a Denjuu reaches a certain level. This takes longer than the other two methods, but is usually the best stat-wise. Another method is fusion evolution, a method that fuses Denjuu with manmade items. While many Denjuu can evolve with this method (and in fact, some Denjuu can only evolve this way), and it is the quickest method, it is generally the worst stat-wise. The last method is lab evolution. These Denjuu evolve from DNA samples from a specific set of Denjuu, and often Denjuu that evolve with this method don’t evolve naturally.

Each level is completed by hitting a block at the end and collecting the Mushroom coming out of it (except for the fourth world, whose “end block” doesn’t work). Beating the fifth “Fortress” level will activate the ending sequence, which shows a picture of two large sized flying Raccoon Marios with the words “THE END” accompanying it. The overworld map is available, but there are no bonus games, nor can Mario interact with the Hammer Bro on the map. The player can also move freely on it in a similar way to Super Mario Bros. Deluxe, as Mario doesn’t move around the map directly (unlike in the original Super Mario Bros. 3), but rather transports immediately to the selected spot. This was probably done intentionally, as sometimes, a raccoon leaf will appear in the box rather than a mushroom, leaving the player trapped, making the level impossible to beat. The levels follow the pattern of the original Super Mario Bros. 3, but only the first five levels are included. The levels themselves are remade from the original game, with the stages made about twice as long with an extra section added at the end.",http://romsfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Super-Mario-Special-3.jpg,,,2000,,,104.84KB,686,1,5,https://romsfun.com/download/super-mario-special-3-110577,,Homebrew
