Saturated with hate and greed the brother will not remain in oblivion for long. He attends a Dark Sorcerer to learn the powers of evil and black magic. The King shall not feel safe for long. 

After years of studies the evil brother himself becomes a Dark Sorceror and is ready to stand up against his brother which he hates with all of his cold heart. But he can not do it alone. He needs an army, a force of warriors to break through the defences of his brother. He therefore turns to Morlock the Soulthief for help and support. The evil demons agrees to the vicious schemes of the King's brother under one circumstance: All souls in the kingdom will for eternity belong to Morlock for his personal satisfaction. Being so Morlock and the evil brother become allies. Allies in blood. Already an evil and sinister plan was forming in the heads of the rulers of darkness. 

Later in the castle of the King the loyal life guards Axel, Tara and Karo stand guard in front of the door to the throne room. Suddenly they hear a deafening noise and the King's cry for help. Swiftly they turn around and knock the door open with their weapons just in time to see a hideous gargoyle standing with the King in its arms. As Axel moves forward to stop the gargoyle two monsters step out of the dark and attack the fearless trio. In the meantime the gargoyle gets away with the motionless body of the King. After a short bloody battle Axel, Tara and Karo are standing alone in the throne room of the King looking out of the scattered window where they can see the shape of the gargoyle vanishing in the horizon.

By destroying objects, killing people, and generally causing all kinds of wanton mayhem, he will increase in power. Cain's rage is represented by an orb-like indicator that undergoes a number of color changes, from the relative calm of green to an infuriated red, and beyond.

The higher the color, the more damage the character can sustain and, as an added bonus, the damage yield of the arm blaster is increased as well. Eventually the protagonist will be capable of unleashing a mighty special attack. Taking too much damage however, will cause the meter to revert to a lower state. Though his primary means of attack is his newfound appendage, John Cain is capable of executing melee attacks as well. He can also perform a handful of evasive maneuvers, such as rolling, strafing and even a double jump, which must be mastered in order to traverse the many platforms and pitfalls that await in the title's eight missions.

In the Raccoon City police headquarters, Jill Valentine, a member of STAR, fled from the city when the disease broke out. During this time, the city was flooded with zombies due to the T-virus. Upon arriving at the police station, Jill Valentine saw Brad Vickers killed by a mysterious monster. This monster is called Nemesis made by Umbrella to destroy all members of the STAR group. Not an ordinary monster, Nemesis had intelligence and they were programmed to destroy targets anywhere on earth. At this time, Jill Valentine will face a great danger from all sides. The player’s mission is to help her escape from this cursed city.
While fleeing from the rampaging monster, Jill met three members of the UBCS team, Nikolai Zinoviev, Carlos Oliveira and Mikhail Victor. The three people who showed Jill how to escape the city were to use a radio device to contact the rescue team to the city’s clock tower. After a series of difficulties crossing the area, Nikolai mysteriously disappeared and was thought to be killed by Nemesis. The rest of the group fled for hours to escape Nemesis’ pursuit. Upon reaching the clock tower and meeting the helicopter, everyone thought that everything would end here. Nemesis appears and destroys the party’s hopes by destroying the helicopter. After escaping from the clock tower and Nemesis’ pursuit again, Jill became infected with the T-virus and lost consciousness on the street. Carlos was the one who found Jill and took her to the hospital to get an anti-T-virus vaccine. Over the next several days, Jill regained consciousness and met Nicolai at the park. He reveals to her a secret of Umbrella, some of Umbrella’s supervisors being sent to the city. These supervisors are monsters created by the Umbrella Corporation to kill the survivors. Leaving the park and continuing the journey, Jill encountered a giant worm and destroyed it. When fleeing to a chemical factory, she met Carlos again, he informed her that the government would use nuclear weapons to fight off the T-virus epidemic. In the end, Jill found a new plane and escaped Raccoon City before the nuclear missile arrived.
Unlike in the previous version, players will need to choose a journey for Jill. All the details of the game are linked, you will probably not see Nicolai again and things will become more difficult.

100063,Tarzan,https://romsfun.com/roms/playstation/tarzan-2.html,playstation,"In this adaptation of Walt Disney's animated film of the same name, Disney's Tarzan for the PlayStation swings into action with 13 levels set within a dangerous jungle. While the graphics are in 3D, play involves moving from left to right to find the exit, similar to that of a 2D platform game. Levels begin with animated film clips, each telling part of the story as Tarzan grows from a young boy to a man.

The jungle is filled with dangerous animals that will diminish Tarzan's health (represented by a vine) every time he makes contact with them. Among the animals you'll encounter are frogs, baboons, rhinos, alligators, coconut-dropping birds and even enemy hunters. Of course, not all the animals are there to hurt you. Your friend, a female gorilla named Terk, will offer some tips along the way, and Tantor the elephant can also help out during certain stages.

Moves include swinging from vine to vine, climbing trees or ledges, jumping over enemies and pounding the ground. The latter technique is useful for revealing hidden power-ups or breaking certain structures so you can continue onward. Tarzan can also throw an unlimited number of fruit at the animals, as well as use a knife and spear (once found).

Besides making his way through the jungle, Tarzan can collect items to help him succeed. These include Tarzan coins (an extra life is earned for every 100 coins collected); letters to spell T-A-R-Z-A-N, which will let you watch opening movies from the option screen; four pieces of a sketch to open up a bonus round; and three different pieces of fruit to increase attack power. Bananas are also available to replenish lost health.

Fans of the animated film will experience levels that closely follow its story, from trying to outrun stampeding elephants to saving Tarzan's gorilla family from the evil hunter Clayton. Players will also be able to slide down a jungle vine at high speeds from a perspective behind Tarzan!

Battle the leopard Sabor and meet up with Professor Porter and his daughter Jane as you strive to become lord of the jungle. A memory card with one block free is required to save progress, but players can revisit past levels to hunt down every artifact. Complete the game with a 100% rating to unlock a special secret!

  Manufacturer's description:

Disney's animated film TARZAN gets the video game treatment and makes his way to the PlayStation. The game follows the plot of the movie: you must help Tarzan grow from a boy to an adult in the span of 14 levels of action. While many of the levels offer platform-jumping, vine-swinging fun, some of them recreate some of the action sequences from the movie. No matter where he is, Tarzan must collect the tokens and fruit that are scattered about. Collecting 100 tokens earns an extra life, and the fruit can be used to dispose of enemies. If you can collect the four pieces of Jane's baboon drawing, you can earn the chance to play a bonus level. You've got to help the young ape-man discover his place in the world with TARZAN.
