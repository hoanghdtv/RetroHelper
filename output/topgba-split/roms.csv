40178,Crash of the Titans,https://romsfun.com/roms/game-boy-advance/crash-of-the-titans-2.html,game-boy-advance,"Crash Bandicoot, with his sister Coco and his friends, came to the island of Wumpa to start a peaceful farmer’s life. While trying to fix the butter processing equipment, Coco and Aku Aku were kidnapped by Dr. Neo Cortex then put on a balloon. Luckily, the butter maker broke the strings so that they escaped, but fell into a forest. They didn’t expect that this was a plan to distract everyone from letting Aku Aku steal Mojo. Cortex planned to create an army of mutants and build a machine to destroy the Doominator to rule the world. Crash promptly stops that, but not completely. Doominator is still in the process of development and completion. Before this threat is officially put into operation, Crash needs to find the last base of the enemy to destroy it entirely.
Wumpa Island, Lumber Yard, N. Sanity Island, Uka Tree, and the Doominator base are five areas that players need to defeat in order to complete the storyline. Quests in almost every stage involve collecting Mojo for a limited period of time. However, they are not available, which have been taken by enemies. Therefore, the only way to get Mojo is to defeat them all.
Unlike previous versions, “Crash of the Titans” is more about action role-playing element than adventure. For that reason, the main character, Crash, has some special abilities to become stronger. Clearer, it is the ability to transform whenever he defeats an enemy. It brings new fighting skills as well as the defense is much increased after that. But if the damage is too much, they will disappear, put Crash back to his original state.
About difficulties, although I have never mentioned earlier, you might have already understood that they will develop proportional to the plot. The closer you get to the Doominator base, the harder it is. Therefore, you obviously also be defeated a few times when facing some bosses at the end of each stage, most notably: Arachnina, Uka Uka, Battler, and Ee-Lectric. Fortunately, the developer is not so callous to let the characters die without any help. Do you remember the Mojo? They are very useful, not a useless item at all. Combine them with the “golden fruit” on the island of Wumpa for an extra life. Besides, eating the fruits found along the way will improve the vitality indicators.",https://romsfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Crash-of-the-Titans.jpg,https://romsfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Crash-of-the-Titans1.jpg|https://romsfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Crash-of-the-Titans2.jpg|https://romsfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Crash-of-the-Titans3.jpg,Arcade,2007,Sierra,EU|US,10.58MB,"2,042",6,4.5,https://romsfun.com/download/crash-of-the-titans-2-3461,,
